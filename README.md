DBSCAN Clustering and Singular Value Decomposition, Optimization using Gradient Descent--


The aim of this project is to analyze the Netflix data in order to fit best answers to the businessesâ€™ questions- like how do we get personalized dashboards on Netflix- by incorporating methods learned so far in R kernel. In this framework, I have been able to extract insights on the following questions:
1. How does Netflix make recommendations when users do not rate any content even after having watched the movies? i.e. How Netflix recommendation engine deals with the cold start problem?
2. HowcollaborativefilteringorSVDrecommendationisbettercomparedtoothers?
Netflix Visualizations, Recommendation, EDA
 3.How various attributes can be used to answer Business questions like how content changes over time in Netflix each time in different scenarios, which can be related to top-rating recommendations, or genres, or rating.
