# RecommendationEngine
### Exploratory Analysis,DBSCAN Clustering and Singular Value Decomposition, Optimization using Gradient Descent.


#### The aim of this project is to analyze the Netflix data in order to fit best answers to the businessesâ€™questions- like how do we get personalized dashboards on Netflix- by incorporating methods learned so far in R kernel. In this framework, I have been able to extract insights on the following questions:

* * How does Netflix make recommendations when users do not rate any content even after having watched the movies? i.e. How Netflix recommendation engine deals with ##### the cold start problem?

* * How Collaborative Filtering or SVDrecommendation is better compared to others?

* * How various attributes can be used to answer Business questions like how content changes over time in Netflix each time in different scenarios, which can be related to top-rating recommendations, or genres, or rating.
